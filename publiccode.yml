    shortDescription: A community-driven library where contributors build, document,
      test, and maintain their own features.
    longDescription: >-
      This library is built as a community-driven ecosystem supported by the
      Oblique team. We provide the foundational scaffolding, development setup,
      and a fully integrated Storybook environment to make documentation
      straightforward and accessible. Our role is intentionally minimal: we
      ensure the project stays healthy by keeping dependencies current and
      maintaining a stable foundation.


      All features, components, and enhancements are contributed by the
      community. Anyone is welcome to add new functionality, with the
      expectation that contributors document their work in Storybook, write and
      maintain tests, and remain responsible for ongoing upkeep of their
      additions. This collaborative model allows the library to grow organically
      while ensuring that every piece of functionality is owned, maintained, and
      explained by its creator.
